        For my final project, I am building the Montana State Soccer club team website 
        with an emphasis on Tailwind CSS integration. This project will showcase modern 
        web design principles using Tailwind's utility-first approach to create a 
        responsive, professional team website with player profiles, game schedules, 
        and team statistics.
